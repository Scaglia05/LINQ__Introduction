LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful .NET feature that allows you to perform queries and manipulate data in an integrated and expressive way. Below, I present an overview of the main methods in LINQ, including Select, First, Last, Single and their Default methods.
Main Methods
Select
The Select method projects each element of a sequence into a new shape, allowing data transformation.
First
The First method returns the first element of a sequence that meets a specified condition. If no element is found, it throws an exception.
FirstOrDefault
The FirstOrDefault method returns the first element that meets a specified condition, or the type's default value if no element is found.
Last
The Last method returns the last element of a sequence that meets a specified condition. If no element is found, it throws an exception.
LastOrDefault
The LastOrDefault method returns the last element that meets a specified condition, or the default value of the type if no element is found.
Single
The Single method returns the only element of a sequence that meets a specified condition. Throws an exception if there are zero or more than one elements that meet the condition.
SingleOrDefault
The SingleOrDefault method returns the only element that meets a specified condition, or the type's default value if no element is found. Throws an exception if there is more than one element that meets the condition.
Conclusion
These methods are essential for queries and data manipulation using LINQ. They provide flexibility and expressiveness for working with different types of collections and data sources in .NET.
